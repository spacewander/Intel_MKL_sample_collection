BLAS Routine Naming Conventions

---Copy from the documentation of Intel MKL---

BLAS routine names have the following structure:

? <name> <mod> ( )

The ? field indicates the data type:

s              real, single precision
c              complex, single precision
d              real, double precision
z              complex, double precision

Some routines and functions can have combined character codes, such as sc or dz. For example, the function scasum uses a complex input array and returns a real value.

The parts of the name have different interpretations in BLAS levels 1, 2, and 3.

BLAS Level 2 Naming Conventions
<name>
ge              general matrix
gb              general band matrix
sy              symmetric matrix
sp              symmetric matrix (packed storage)
sb              symmetric band matrix
he              Hermitian matrix
hp              Hermitian matrix (packed storage)
hb              Hermitian band matrix
tr              triangular matrix
tp              triangular matrix (packed storage)
tb              triangular band matrix.
<mod>
The <name> field, in BLAS level 1, indicates the operation type. For example, the BLAS level 1 routines ?dot, ?rot, ?swap compute a vector dot product, vector rotation, and vector swap, respectively.

In BLAS level 2 and 3, <name> reflects the matrix argument type:

The <mod> field, if present, provides additional details of the operation. BLAS level 1 names can have the following characters in the <mod> field:

c               conjugated vector
u               unconjugated vector
g               Givens rotation construction
m               modified Givens rotation
mg              modified Givens rotation construction

BLAS level 2 names can have the following characters in the <mod> field:

mv              matrix-vector product
sv              solving a system of linear equations with a single unknown vector
r               rank-1 update of a matrix
r2              rank-2 update of a matrix.

BLAS level 3 names can have the following characters in the <mod> field:

mm              matrix-matrix product
sm              solving a system of linear equations with multiple unknown vectors
rk              rank-k update of a matrix
r2k             rank-2k update of a matrix.

The examples below illustrate how to interpret BLAS routine names:

ddot
<d> <dot>: double-precision real vector-vector dot product
cdotc
<c> <dot> <c>: complex vector-vector dot product, conjugated
scasum
<sc> <asum>: sum of magnitudes of vector elements, single precision real output and single precision complex input
cdotu
<c> <dot> <u>: vector-vector dot product, unconjugated, complex
sgemv
<s> <ge> <mv>: matrix-vector product, general matrix, single precision
ztrmm
<z> <tr> <mm>: matrix-matrix product, triangular matrix, double-precision complex.

Sparse BLAS level 1 naming conventions are similar to those of BLAS level 1.
